# Taxation-Program
Java project to calculate taxes

Different classes work together based on object-oriented programming (OOP) principles to calculate the taxes that need to be paid depending on variables such as the number of people/dependents in the household, marital status, or the tax brackets.

This program is not meant to be used to calculate taxes and is purely for educational purposes.
